## Releasing a new version
To fully release a new version, you need to have access to the @materializecss organization on the npmjs. Then, please follow the steps below:

1. In your local copy of Materialize, go into the dev Branch with `git checkout v2-dev` and pull the newest version
   with `git pull origin v2-dev` to have the newest version from the server. Run Tests and check if everything works.

2. Create a new Release branch with `git checkout -b release-2.X.X`.
   In case something happens or needs to be changed during the release it is better to keep the release on its own branch.

3. Run `npm version <change-type>`
   Where `<change-type> = patch, minor, major`. 
   [details](https://docs.npmjs.com/updating-your-published-package-version-number)

4. Verify that the version is correctly replaced and files were generated in:
   * package.json
   * src/index.ts
   * dist/js
   * dist/css

5. Add Commit with message "chore: release 2.X.X-alpha". Then push to server.

6. Create a Pull Request (PR) ([example](https://github.com/materializecss/materialize/pull/258) so that we can verify nothing goes wrong, address the feedback from the reviewers if there is any

7. Create a new (draft) release on GitHub
   * Click generate Release notes automatically and select previeous version (commit-lint of commit-messages is important here)
   * Upload the `materialize-v<new_version>.zip` from the bin-folder
   * Create a new tag together with the release

8. Merge the Pull Request if all checks pass and there were no concerns.
   * Set the draft release to public.

9. Checkout and pull the new **main**-branch locally, merge it back into the **dev**-branch. Then push to server. [Explanation here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72959052)
   ```git checkout main
      git pull origin main
      git checkout v2-dev
      git pull origin v2-dev
      git merge main
      git push origin v2-dev
   ```

10. Publish the release on npmjs
   * If you never logged in on npm, please do `npm login` first and enter your credentials
   * Then run `npm publish` and follow the instructions there

11. Done! Yay new version ðŸ¥³
